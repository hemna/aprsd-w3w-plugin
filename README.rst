Features
--------

Unfortunately, since w3w has changed their API to a paid subscription service, this plugin is now defunct.
Here is the email from what3words.com sent their users.


.. code:: console

    We’re getting in touch to let you know about a change to the features
    available with the Free what3words API plan.

    Our Free API plan continues to support the AutoSuggest feature but
    will soon no longer include the ‘convert to what3words address’ feature
    (the function that converts a set of coordinates to their corresponding
    what3words addresses) or map grid (which displays what3words gridlines
    of 3 metre squares). If you would like to continue using these features,
    you can upgrade to one of our paid API plans anytime before 25th November 2024,
    which is when the changes will come into effect.

    Our business plans (starting at £7.99/month) all come with unlimited
    ‘convert to what3words address’ conversions and unlimited grid calls.
    Other features such as ‘convert-to-coordinate’ requests, as well as
    priority and developer support are also available depending on your choice of plan.

    You can learn more about our full range of API plans here. Your API key
    will not change as part of this update. If you have any questions about
    how this change might affect you or would like to speak with our team,
    feel free to reply to this email and we’d be happy to help.

    As a reminder, emergency services can make use of the what3words API
    for free and we have a dedicated plan for registered charities,
    therefore these organisations are not subject to our standard
    pricing model or impacted by this update. If your organisation
    falls within these categories then please do get in touch to let us know.
